# Git Workflow Rules

## Branches

`main` is the protected integration branch.

Agent branches must follow:

```txt
agent/<harness>/<ticket-or-task>/<short-slug>
```

Allowed harness names:

- `codex`
- `claude`
- `gemini`
- project-defined lowercase ids

## Main Synchronization

Agents must be up to date with `origin/main`:

- before implementation
- before opening a pull request
- before reporting completion

Use:

```bash
scripts/agent-preflight.sh
scripts/agent-sync-main.sh
scripts/agent-preflight.sh
```

## Merge Authority

Agents must not merge to `main`.

The human maintainer:

1. Reviews the PR branch against `main`.
2. Checks CI results.
3. Runs any local validation they want.
4. Merges or asks for changes.

## Conflict Policy

If syncing with `main` creates conflicts, stop and report:

- conflicted files
- likely cause
- proposed resolution

Do not invent a conflict resolution for domain logic without human review.
